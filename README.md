# Lab 03 Control Towers and Airports

### Introduction

The purpose of this lab was to familiarize ourselves with basic scripting and coding necessary to implement  webmaps. Additionall, several Leaflet techniques for implementing layers with geojson where used.



### Functions

The major functions of the lab are:

- PointToLayer functions on the airport geojson which indicates the "name" value of each airport
- PointToLayer function on the state boundary geojson which indicates the "count" of airports in each particular "state"
- A LayerControl function which allows for changing of the basemaps available through Map Box, in the top right corner
- A ZoomToFeature function which zooms to the bounds of each state
- A HighlightFeature and ResetFuture for mouse on and mouse off events, respectively
